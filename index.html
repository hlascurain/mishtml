<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I'm a first-year student at McCombs and I plan on majoring in marketing. My hope is that I can use my business degree to work in the music/entertainment industry for a company like C3 Presents. I absolutely love music---in fact, I am in student radio at UT! It should also be noted that I enjoy long walks on the beach (although not in Corpus Christi or Galveston). <br /><br /></p>
